This tutorial introduces the basic steps required
to create and run a multistage delivery and self-healing project with Keptn.
In this tutorial we use the Prometheus observability platform
as our data source from which we define SLO-based Quality Gates
and we use Locust to generate a lot for our evaluations.

This is an annotated transcript of the
[Keptn End to End Delivery](https://killercoda.com/keptn/scenario/keptn-end-to-end-delivery)
tutorial published through KilrCoda.

In addition to a full transcript of that tutorial,
this document includes additional information about the "behind the sceness" tasks
that the tutorial executes to set up the working Keptn environment
and run the exercises.
